JSON - Javascript Object Notation

Way for us developers to store and send data.
Often used when you want to send a piece of data from a server to a client(that is to a browser)

In our case we are using this manifest.json file to configure our app and to provide metadata about it.

{
    "manifest_version": 3,
    "version": "1.1",
    "name": "Leads tracker", 
    "action": {
        "default_popup": "index.html",
        "default_icon": "icon.png"
    }
}

"manifest_version" - telling chrome which version of this json file we are using

"version" so if we change it to e.g "1.1" it will know that we upgraded our version.

"name" - google chrome will give our app the name "Leads tracker"

"action" - kind of the MEAT of our application. It configures what happens when the user clicks on our application from the google chrome extension tool bar
